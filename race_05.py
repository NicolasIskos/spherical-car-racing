# Welcome to the Race 2 of the Spherical Car Racing tournament!
#
# Today we're going to go back to the basics, and study a single 90ยบ corner.
# How hard can that be?
#
# TODO: draw the map as a PNG. For now, here's the text description:
#   You start anywhere between (0,0) and (20,0) drive at INITIAL_SPEED in the
#   direction of the y axis (i.e. up on the map).
#   You need to go around the cone at (20, 100), and finish between (120, 100)
#   and (120, 120).
#   Before the cone, you need to be between 0 and 20 on the x axis; after the
#   cone you need to be between 100 and 120 on the y axis.
#
# The current record is 6.837 seconds. Can you match or even beat it?
#
# Only modify the code between the "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES" and the
# "FINISH" lines.

# Below is a very naive (and not the fastest!) solution.
# Edit it to your liking and see how much faster you can make the driver.
#
# Tip: try to solve this using your physics knowledge.
# This time it's probably too hard to make the solution generic enough, so I'm
# not going to tempt you with brownie points.

# Intentionally picking an unoptimal initial value so that you can play around
# with the naive solution and quantify how much difference "using the whole
# width of the track" makes.

# You can change the initial speed to your liking.

# Inputs:
#   x, y: coordinates relative to the starting position, in meters.

#   You can use any acceleration such that (ax**2 + ay**2) <= MAX_TRACTION**2.
#   Basically this spherical car is AWD and has enough power to spin the wheels
#   at any speed it can achieve in this race. Think Tesla Model S Plaid,
#   Lucid Air Sapphire or Bugatti Veyron. We assume that it can change direction
#   as desired, without limitation or negative effect to the overall traction.
#   It's a heck of a car!
#
#   Note that (ax, ay) are specified in the global frame of reference, not the
#   moving frame of reference of the car.
