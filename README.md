# Spherical Car Racing

You might have heard the term
"[spherical cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow)"
or "spherical horse" as a way to simplify a complex concept to illustrate some
point without unnecessary details.

As car racing is one of my passions, I figured why don't we try racing spherical
cars, and learn something along the way?

## Prerequisites

You should have solid beginner understanding of Python to be able to program
your "driver".

Basic understanding of school level physics is recommended.

Very basic understanding of Git commands such as
[`git clone`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
and
[`git pull`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository)
is required
to get the source code and keep it up to date.

It's recommended to
[install the Pillow library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
so that you can get nice graphs to simplify debugging your racers.

## Race 01

Please make sure you have the latest version of this repository.

Open [`race_01.py`](race_01.py) and read the comment at the start of the file
for rules and tips on how to proceed.

This is a very simple race, the main purpose here is to let people learn how to
race a spherical car in Python :)

Have fun!

## Race 02

Open [`race_02.py`](race_02.py) and read the comment at the start of the file
for rules and tips on how to proceed.

In this race you might learn something interesting and counter-intuitive.
